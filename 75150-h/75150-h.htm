</div>

<p>Highly important as are the phenomena of
Radioactivity from the physical, chemical, medical,
and philosophic points of view, they are
hardly comparable in their relations to the
affairs of our everyday life to the Roentgen or
X-rays, and to the invisible violet or ultra-violet
rays. The X-rays are utilized today in
hundreds of practical ways, and are vastly important
also in surgery, medicine, dentistry,
and in biological investigations. It is perhaps
not too much to say that the discovery of the
so-called X-rays should be numbered among the
two or three most important revelations of
modern science. This will be clearly demonstrated
in the course of the chapters to follow.</p>

<span class="fs70">EVERYDAY USES OF X-RAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>To enumerate and describe all the practical
uses of X-rays, apart from medicine and scientific
research in general, would require a good
many more pages than can be devoted to the
subject here. To take a few cases at random,
without describing the instruments and methods
employed: radiography reveals flaws in the
structure of iron and steel building and bridge
materials, and in the cylinders of airplane engines,
and so avoids accidents. In England a
gasoline or petrol tank was shown to have
rivet heads on the outside and none on the
inside.</p>

<p>Serious defects in the steel axles of railway
and automobile “under carriages” have been
discovered by radiography. In one case, at
least, the axles had been drilled in the wrong
position and the holes had been simply filled
with metal and covered over. An entire lot
was rejected in consequence and probably serious
accidents were forestalled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cracks in castings, bad welds and weak
places which do not show on the surface of
metal are perfectly clear to the searching rays.
How much would you give to <em>know</em> that that
welded part in your automobile is really solid
and perfect, that it contains no flaw to break
down some day when you are twenty miles
from a machine shop? A well-known mechanical
engineer said recently that in ten years a
metallurgical X-ray machine will be as vital a
part of the equipment in an automobile repair
shop, a foundry, or machine shop as it is now
in a dentist’s office.”</p>
</div>

<p>We are assured by <cite>The Iron Trade</cite> (73:26)
that “the practice of analyzing metals by means
of X-rays is only in its infancy. There is every
reason to believe that soon great advances will
be made in determining the crystallization and
therefore the properties of metals. Students of
metallurgy are well aware that the properties
of metals and other bodies depend on the nature
of their crystallization. The microscope
has rendered valuable service largely because it
enables the form and arrangement of the crystalline
grains to be studied. The X-ray carries
the same form of inquiry into a region 10,000
times more minute, thereby furnishing new evidence
as to crystalline structures, so that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
now possible to see the atoms and the molecules,
and the way they form crystals. Every
crystal has its characteristic X-ray spectrum
and can be identified thereby even when the
individual crystals are beyond the resolving
power of the microscope and the substance is
in danger of being called amorphous. If a
specimen contains a mixture of crystalline substances,
the spectrum shows the combined effect
of all the substances, and provided each
individual spectrum is known, the specimen
can be analyzed.”</p>

<p>The X-rays are also used to determine the
quality of the fabric in automobile tires, and
even to detect irregularities in the centers of
golf balls, and to reveal why some of them
fly straighter and farther than others.</p>

<p>“The professional detective, too,” says Mr.
Wilfred S. Ogden (<cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite>,
August, 1923), “will find X-rays useful in his
business. Consider the detection of infernal
machines, for example. Two or three X-ray
plates will tell an investigator just what is
in a suspicious-looking box. If it is a bomb
the X-ray will show him how to get it apart
and render it harmless. Immediate detection
of false bottoms in trunks is child’s play with
the X-ray. When the government provided its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
customs inspectors with X-ray machines the
gems which smugglers try to hide in the linings
of clothes or in hollow-handled hairbrushes
might as well be worn openly.</p>

<p>“The X-rays give us one of the easiest ways
to detect the alteration of checks and other
documents. It is seldom that such an alteration
is made with exactly the same ink used
on the original. Inks even of the same color,
differ in the way they affect the rays. In most
cases all that is necessary to detect an alteration
is to place the suspected document for a
moment under the X-rays and make a photograph
of it. The new ink used in the alteration
will stand out clearly as different from the
old.</p>

<p>“The industrial detective will find X-rays
just as useful. The adulteration of foods by
sawdust, sand or clay; the adding of too much
filler to paper; the presence of grit in lubricating
oil, all will be revealed.</p>

<p>“Another use of the rays comes home to
every cook and housewife. X-rays constitute
the only sure way to tell good eggs from bad.
Pass each egg in turn through the X-rays and
let its shadow fall on a chemical screen. You
will see exactly what is inside each egg. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
ones containing hopeful chicks may be rejected.”</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable economic or
biological uses of the X-ray so far developed is
the study of silk-worms and their diseases. The
Silk Association of America has established a
laboratory—Department of Sericulture—in the
Canton Christian College, presided over by a
staff of Chinese and foreign entomologists.
Here the silk-worm is X-rayed by powerful
microscopes, and all his disorders diagnosed
and corrected, says Mr. Philip A. Yountz
(<cite>Scientific American</cite>, September, 1925).</p>

<p>“Numerous autopsies on deceased members
of the silk-worm tribe revealed that from 50
to 100 percent of the worms raised in South
China were infected with diseases that made
the infant mortality rate excessively high and
destroyed the value of the silk from those
hardy enough to survive. The elimination of
these diseases would enable South China to
produce four or five times as much silk.”</p>

<p>In Great Britain, X-rays are used in the analysis
of coal, the method being an adaptation
of the X-ray stereoscope.</p>

<p>In Berlin, S. Nalken, a noted criminologist,
has devised an important improvement in finger-print
identification. X-ray pictures are obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
of the finger, with the muscles and
bones. This is done without the use of any
chemicals that could obstruct the delicate furrows
of the finger lines. Moreover, the finger
bone is shaped so characteristically as to aid
identification. Whenever a certain likeness of
finger-lines is discovered, the bones are examined
to see if further research is necessary.</p>

<p>Picture fakers have been dethroned by application
of the X-ray to paintings. Recently
painted “old masters” are now easily detected.
Modern artists use white-lead, which is more
opaque than the “priming” or “sizing” used by
the older artists; and the X-ray device “made
in Germany” in 1914 by Dr. Faber, and further
developed by the French expert, Dr. André
Chéron, at once distinguishes the old from the
new. One picture by Van Ostade, of men drinking
at a table, proved to be a fraud when submitted
to the X-ray; it had been painted over
a study of dead birds. Another, called “The
Royal Child,” a supposed 16th century work,
now in the Louvre, was proved to have been
painted during the 19th century over a picture
of very much earlier date.</p>

<p>During a popular lecture on the X-ray in
London, before the Royal Institution, the distinguished
physicist, Prof. G. W. C. Kaye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
showed a number of radiograph slides, among
which were two pictures by Dutch painters, one
representing the Madonna and the other the
Crucifixion. In the former, the Madonna appeared
to be looking at something which was
non-existent in the canvas, and a radiograph
proved the missing object was a child which
some former owner of the picture had painted
out. In the second picture, a woman in the
attitude of prayer was found to have been
painted over what was in the original the
figure of a man in monk’s garb.</p>

<p>The first X-ray pictures ever taken of a mummy
were completed by scientists at the American
Museum of Natural History, New York
City. The pictures showing the skeleton in detail
are expected to be a great aid in studying
the development of bone formations in the
evolution of man. This first subject of the
scientists’ X-ray was a South American Indian
mummy. Fake mummies, like false gems, are
instantly detected by X-ray methods.</p>

<p>One of the methods used for detecting the
theft of diamonds at the mines is to examine
the workmen with X-rays. Of course, a fluoroscope
is used to make the X-ray image visible,
and this is the type used in any regular
X-ray work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>The X-rays are now being used in shoe-stores—“foot-o-scope”
instruments—to enable shoe
salesmen to see the bones of a customer’s foot
and thus make correct fittings of shoes.</p>

<p>A few years ago there arrived from Germany
a new kind of mechanical doll. “A secret
mechanism inside enabled it to walk, sit down
or stand up, and to do other unusual things.
The importer in possession of the sample doll
would not allow it to be opened. But one of
the competitors borrowed the doll. He had
promised not to open it. But he made some
X-ray photographs of it. Now he is manufacturing
these dolls himself.”</p>

<p>During the World War every effort was made
to introduce contraband materials into Germany
and if it had not been for the all-seeing
eye of the Roentgen ray, it would have been
impossible to prevent materials of the utmost
importance to the enemy from reaching him
by way of neutral countries. Efforts were made
repeatedly to smuggle rubber and copper by
burying them in bales or bundles of other materials.
It would have been impossible to have
made a minute investigation of every bale that
was shipped, but by means of X-rays it was
possible to see through these bundles and
packages and locate any substances that were
more or less opaque to the rays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The X-ray has been found useful for examining
timber up to 18 inches thick for internal
knots, resin pockets, cracks and other defects.</p>

<p>“When submarines were active and the supply
of the best kinds of wood was uncertain,
it was necessary to make some of the wooden
parts out of small pieces of ordinary wood
fitted and glued together. The way these pieces
were joined and fastened was extremely important.
A bit of weak glue inside some little
strut might mean a disastrous collapse in the
air. But real inspection seemed impossible, for
the places where important faults might exist
were hidden from view. Finally scientists
solved the problem by building an X-ray apparatus
with which they could look into the
inside of each built-up airplane part and tell
whether it held some little imperfection which
might prove dangerous.</p>

<p>“This ‘internal inspection’ of wooden articles
by X-ray has been applied, since the war, to
many other articles. Hidden joints inside high-class
furniture and cabinet work, invisible
knots and flaws inside the wood itself, can be
determined easily by X-ray examination.” (W.
S. Ogden).</p>

<p><cite>The Scientific American</cite> (September, 1924)
published an abstract of a paper read before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the <em>Deutschen Bunsen-Gesellschaft</em>, in which
Dr. D. Coster showed that “the relations between
the X-ray spectra of the different elements
are so simple that, in some respects,
they are more useful for purposes of chemical
analysis than ordinary luminous spectra. An
important advantage is the fact that the X-ray
spectrum of an element is quite independent
of the nature of the compound containing it.
It is easy to detect the presence in a mixture
of which not more than one milligram is available.
Certain precautions are necessary in examining
the X-ray spectra; although the number
of lines for each element is comparatively
limited, recent observations have shown the
existence of a number of weaker lines; in addition
to this, with the high voltages now generally
used, not only the spectrum of the first
order, but also those of higher orders appear.
Slight impurities in the material of the anticathode,
and in the subject under examination,
also give their lines, so that there are often
various possibilities to be considered before a
given line can be explained. Not only the
wave length, but also the typical appearance
of the suspected lines must be considered, as
well as their relative intensity. By measuring
photometrically the intensity of the spectral
lines it is possible, in some cases, to obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
a quantitative estimate of the amount of an
element present in a mixture.”</p>

<p>Another method of rapid analysis of material
in the laboratory by the use of X-rays in a
much shorter time than that required by the
older chemical methods is that devised by
Professor Urbain, of the Minero-Chemical Laboratory
at the Sorbonne, with the assistance of
Eugene Delaunay. Mr. Delaunay, who did the
actual work of testing the new X-ray method,
says there is no risk of error.</p>

<p>By employment of X-rays the scientist is now
able to ascertain the arrangement of the atoms
and molecules within the crystal “network”
(structure—or “space lattice” of the crystal).<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The results are obtained from the study of the
reflection and refraction of the rays by the
crystals, or, more precisely, the successive rows
of molecules in the crystal. These act toward
the extremely short X-rays in the same way as
a grating spectroscope does to ordinary light-rays.</p>

<p>Man’s ability to lengthen the ultra-violet end
of the spectrum is limited by his capacity to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
provide a diffraction grating, or a mineral
prism, which can split up light-waves of increasingly
greater frequency (or shortness).
The width of a grating space (a fine line on
speculum metal, which acts as a minute mirror)
must be comparable to the wave length
of the light. Previous to the discoveries of
Prof. Max von Laue in Munich (now in Zurich),
and Prof. William Henry Bragg, of the University
of London, no grating or other material
was known whose spaces were as small as the
wave length of X-rays. Laue conceived the
brilliant idea that the regular arrangement of
the atoms in a crystal might serve the purpose.
They did. Bragg, and later his son, Prof. W.
L. Bragg, of the University of Manchester, followed
up the work of Laue with results of immeasurable
value to science.</p>

<p>A very important relation between the atomic
number of an element and its X-ray spectrum
was discovered by the brilliant young English
physicist, H. G. T. Moseley (1888-1915), in his
26th year, a year before his death by a Turkish
bullet at the Dardanelles. While analyzing the
characteristic X-rays which are given off when
any kind of substance is bombarded with cathode
rays, Moseley found that the atoms of
all the different substances emit radiations or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
groups of radiations which are extraordinarily
similar, but which differ in their wave lengths
as we proceed from substance to substance; the
frequencies (wave lengths) change by definite
steps as one progresses from elements of lower
to elements of higher atomic weights. Through
Moseley’s epoch-making discovery we now
know that each of the 92 elements, from hydrogen
to uranium, is built up by successive additions
of one positive charge (proton) and
one negative electron, and that the atomic
numbers—from 1 to 92—correspond to the number
of protons and electrons in each successively
heavier (and more complex) atom.</p>

<span class="fs70">CURATIVE VALUE OF X-RAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In my Little Blue Book on Radium (No.
1000), it is shown that the “emanation” and
the “gamma rays” of radioactive substances
are being used to great advantage in our hospitals,
but that certain dangers to the patient’s
normal cells attended employment of these
radiations.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to note that successful X-ray
treatments are now being given in cases of
cancer, rays being produced—under high-tension
currents—that are almost identical with
the gamma rays of radium.</p>

<p>Moreover, the X-rays have a double value in
medicine. In the first place, they are used as
an aid to diagnosis, forming those branches
of radiotherapy known as radioscopy and radiography.
Then they are also used to great advantage
in the alleviation or cure of certain
maladies. By means of radioscopic or radiographic
examination it may be found that there
is a tumor in the chest, and as a result of that
diagnosis it may be decided to institute treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
(radiotherapy) by means of X-rays or
radium rays or the two combined.</p>

<p>The method of employing extremely penetrating
X-rays—under high voltage and amperage—seems
to have been first used in Germany,
during the World War, but was soon developed
to a high degree of efficiency in France, England,
and the United States, especially by Dr.
William Duane, professor of biophysics at Harvard.</p>

<p>As early as 1919, Professor Dessauer, in Germany,
produced the penetrating X-rays by
means of a high-tension current ranging from
170,000 to 240,000 volts. It was later found, that
rays at 200,000 volts became homogeneous, so
that a further increase was considered as of no
therapeutic value.</p>

<p>In March, 1923, Dr. I. Seth Hirsch, head of the
X-ray department of the Bellevue Hospital in
New York, gave a drastic treatment—for cancer—of
four periods of 16 hours each with the
X-rays at 250,000 volts, apparently with satisfactory
results. The patient suffered no pain
or inconvenience during the treatment with
the exception of occasional nausea. A year
later an experiment was made in a Philadelphia
laboratory where an X-ray treatment of
300,000 volts was used. It seems that alleviation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
rather than cure has been the result of
nearly all cases where cancer had been well
advanced.</p>

<p>Other important improvements, meanwhile,
were being introduced by the German specialists,
during the World War and later, among
which was the just mentioned method of giving
large tissue-destroying doses, requiring from
ten to 15 hours; to this was added careful filtration
of the rays, and the invention of the
<em>ionto</em>—a quantimeter for exact measurements.
A number of malignant diseases is reported to
have yielded to this new system of massive
doses under higher voltage. But Professor
Duane has stated that neither X-rays nor the
gamma rays of radium should be considered as
a permanent cure for cancer.</p>

<p>Until recently the tubes in which X-rays are
produced have always been made of glass. The
latest discovery is a tube made of fused silica,
or vitreosil. Vitreosil permits the passage of
the short rays, will stand a much higher temperature
than glass, and is much stronger.
This means more continuous service from
X-rays.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Francis C. Wood, director
of the Crocker Institute of Cancer Research of
Columbia University, a marked advance in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
treatment of cancer has been made possible by
a new type of X-ray tube, the invention of Dr.
C. T. Ulrey, of the Westinghouse Company.
The new tube has a higher emissive power—in
other words, it is as if the candle-power of
an ordinary lamp were increased six-fold. It
is besides designed for use with higher voltages
than have previously been practical in Roentgenology.
The result is to reduce the necessary
exposure from two or three hours per patient
to 20 minutes, and to increase the life of
the tubes. Incidentally, the new tube gives a
greater proportion of the type of rays that cure
certain forms of cancer, and less of the sort
that attack healthy tissue.</p>

<p>A revolutionary discovery by Dr. Jacques
Forestier, of Aix-les-Bains, France, for which
a gold medal was awarded him in 1925 by the
French Academy, has made possible a method
of exact diagnosis by X-rays heretofore deemed
by many workers impossible of attainment.</p>

<p>As is well known, it is not difficult to make
an X-ray picture of the bones of the body. They
are so much denser than the soft parts of the
body that, even with the ordinary photographic
plate, it has been possible to photograph them
fairly well. By pumping the stomach full of
gas or air—which are highly transparent to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
X-rays—and then applying the X-ray, it has
sometimes been possible to locate the beginnings
of cancer of the stomach, and the place
of malignant growth.</p>

<p>Another method in common use is to give
the patient about a pint of some substance
opaque to X-rays, such as bismuth carbonate,
thus making it possible to record the passage
of the mixture, the outline of the stomach and
the intestines thus being made visible. In this
way ulcers of the stomach have been frequently
located.</p>

<p>Bismuth and similar substances could not be
injected into the brain or spinal cord, on account
of their poisonous effect on the highly
sensitive cells of these regions. Now, thanks
to the method discovered by Dr. Forestier, the
cavities of the brain and spine can be safely
explored, as well as the network of bronchial
tubes in the lung—the so-called “bronchial
tree.”</p>

<p>In an interview with Mr. David Dietz, Dr.
Forestier said (in part):</p>

<p>“I make use of a French oil called lipiodol.
It is a chemical compound composed of poppyseed
oil and iodine. The chemical previously
had been used as a treatment for certain diseases,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
such as goiter. But no one had ever
thought of using it in X-ray work.</p>

<p>“I noticed that where patients had been
treated with lipiodol opaque spots appeared
when X-ray pictures were made of the treated
parts. It occurred to me, therefore, that lipiodol
could be used as a means of making photographs.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, in company with Dr. Sicard
of Paris, I began to experiment. We worked
with animals until we were convinced of the
correctness of our method. When we were
sure that it was safe we tried it on human
beings. I have used it in more than 5,000 cases
in Europe without having a single adverse
result.</p>

<p>“The lipiodol is injected into the brain cavity
or the canal of the spinal cord or the bronchial
tubes and then a regular X-ray photograph is
made. The oil renders the injected part opaque
to X-rays and they show up as sharp black
images in the photographs.</p>

<p>“The method is of particular value when a
patient is suffering from paralysis which has
been caused by a pressure of a tumor or growth
somewhere along the spinal cord. In this case
a drop of the oil is injected into the spinal
canal at the base of the brain. In a healthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
patient it would immediately travel to the base
of the spine. But in the paralyzed patient it
only travels as far as the point of compression.
The X-ray picture therefore reveals the drop of
oil as a black spot. The surgeon then knows
the exact spot at which to operate in order to
find the growth causing the pressure, which
in turn results in paralysis.</p>

<p>“In diagnosing the lungs with the use of
lipiodol the injection in the bronchial tree enables
the X-ray worker to tell at once whether
the patient is suffering from diseases of the
bronchial tubes themselves, or from diseases of
the lung tissue, such as tuberculosis.”</p>

<p>It is gratifying to be able to relate that along
with the improvements already described, progress
has also been made in the preparation of
photographic plates required by the radiographer.
Until recently no photographic plate
had been made which fully met the requirements
of X-ray work, and there was little contrast
in X-ray photographs. They were all
much too sensitive to the longer (visible) wave
lengths, and produced blurring effects.</p>

<p>Early in 1921 an excellent photographic plate,
25 times more rapid than anything previously
known, was invented by Dr. Leonard A. Levey,
a prominent member of the Roentgen Society.
It makes an X-ray photograph of the vital organs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of the living body whose movements have
hitherto blurred the images on the ordinary
photographic plate. Distinct pictures of the
heart, lungs and stomach can now be made.
Dr. Levey has made snapshot photographs of
the heart, lungs and kidneys. All were taken
in a flash with the X-rays on the new plate.</p>

<p>Dr. H. Becher has called the attention of
Americans to the achievement of Dr. Schleussner,
an eminent German authority in photochemical
matters, who has succeeded, after
years of investigation, in sensitizing photographic
plates for X-ray use by an addition of
certain organic salts which are absorbed by
the grains of silver bromide on the photographic
plate. The plate thus formed is very
responsive to the soft rays of an X-ray tube.
The soft rays are relatively longer than the
hard Roentgen rays. One could compare the
soft rays to blue-violet light, if their effects
on this new photographic plate are used for the
comparison. Photographs taken with such
plates give very contrasting effects.</p>

<p>On the “Neo-Roentgen plate” the effect of the
yellow light was almost nil. For this reason,
developing the plate is considerably facilitated,
as the plate can be exposed to yellow light and
the attendant, who need not be a skilled operator,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
can examine the plate in a rather brilliant
light without necessarily guessing at possible
results. The examination of the plate
under a ruby light is, therefore, completely
done away with. It follows that if the new
X-ray plate should come into general use, much
clearer X-ray photographs would be possible;
the time of exposure could be decreased; an
unskilled operator could develop the plate in a
room flooded with yellow light. Such improved
plates are now being extensively used.</p>

<p>While not attempting to enumerate all the
special affections to which X-ray therapy is
now being successfully applied, a few uses may
be mentioned.</p>


<h2><span class="fs70">X-RAYS CURE WHOOPING COUGH</span></h2>

<p>In a preliminary report published in the
<cite>Medical and Surgical Journal</cite> (Boston), Dr.
Henry I. Bowditch and Dr. Ralph D. Leonard
express the belief that a valuable cure for
whooping cough has been found in X-ray treatment
of this disease, which has stubbornly
resisted most, if not all, of the other remedies
applied.</p>

<p>Definite improvement was noted in most of
26 cases of active pertussis (whooping cough)
treated with the X-ray, the subjects of which
ranged in age from three months to 40 years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
with disease stages from one to ten weeks.
The physicians added that they could not give
any rational explanation of the action through
which the X-ray appeared to produce beneficial
results. The report said:</p>

<p>“Each patient received three or four applications
of the X-ray at intervals of two or
three days.”</p>

<p>Many of these cases have not been observed
sufficiently long to determine the final result.
Nevertheless, “it is evident to us that there resulted
a definite improvement in these patients
which cannot be explained by mere accident....
It does not seem likely that [the beneficial
result] is due to any direct bactericidal
property of the X-ray.</p>

<p>“We feel warranted in classifying a small
percentage of these 26 cases under the heading
of “prompt cures.” By this we mean that after
two or three applications of X-rays, covering a
period of six days, the spasms and whoops entirely
disappeared and the patients were clinically
well, except for, possibly, a very slight
cough.</p>

<p>“The bulk of the cases, however, we have
classified as relieved. This group consists of
perhaps 70 percent of the total. By relieved
we mean that there has been a gradual diminution
in the number of spasms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“There is a small percentage of cases, perhaps
10 to 15 percent, which apparently were
not relieved. In this group are included one
moribund case and one rather difficult feeding
case.</p>

<p>“While our evidence so far is not sufficient to
warrant any definite conclusions, we have the
feeling that the X-ray at the present time may
be of more value in the treatment of pertussis
than any other form of treatment, including
serum.”</p>

<h2><span class="fs70">X-RAYS FOR MALARIA</span></h2>

<p>An Italian physician, Dr. Antonio Pais, of
Venice, has since 1916 been successfully treating
malaria by means of X-rays. This treatment
is, however, not employed as a substitute
for quinine, but merely to reinforce its action.
The X-rays are directed toward the region of
the spleen, and the effect is to reduce its enlargement.
At the same time the composition
of the blood is modified. The success obtained
by Dr. Pais has, according to the <cite>Bibliothèque
Universelle et Révue Suisse</cite> (Lausanne), been
so great that the Italian Government decided
to introduce his method of treatment into the
military hospitals.</p>

<p>Since the war the treatment has been studied
by Prof. B. Grassi, who made a report, at an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Italian scientific meeting, in which he declared
the action of X-rays upon chronic malaria
to be “truly marvelous.” The <cite>Bibliothèque
Universelle</cite> says, regarding earlier treatments:</p>

<p>“The attempt was made by them to destroy
the parasite contained in the spleen. But it is
now known that the X-rays employed for therapeutic
action have no effect upon micro-organisms,
although they may be injurious to
the elements of the blood. In the method devised
by Dr. Pais, the X-rays are employed to
stimulate the functioning of the spleen, of the
marrow, and of the lympathic elements by
means of slight but prolonged excitation; they
are employed in infinitesimal doses—homeopathically,
so to speak. Thus the result is absolutely
different as well as the method.”</p>

<p>Dr. James B. Murphy demonstrated that accompanying
cancer grafts on immune animals
there occurs a general increase in the circulating
lymphocytes and hyperplasia of the lymphoid
tissue. When the lymphoid tissue of immune
animals was destroyed, the immunibility was
annulled. Two methods of increasing the lymphocytes
have been found, namely, diffuse
small doses of X-rays, and dry heat. Mice with
lymphocytosis induced by these agents show
Increased resistance to replants of their own
tumors. The results afford ground for hope of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
human application. (Reported in <cite>Scientific
American Monthly</cite>, January, 1920, page 96.)</p>

<p>It has been found that actively growing
tissue, whether normal or pathological, is the
most susceptible to X-rays, and it is comparatively
easy to sterilize a number of species
of animals without otherwise injuring them.
(Prof. James W. Mayor, <cite>Science</cite>, September 23,
1921.) C. R. Bardeen found that X-rays prevent
worms from regenerating lost parts. Observations
of the effect of exposure to X-rays on
the fertility of animals were described in a
paper by Prof. L. H. Snyder of the North Carolina
College of Agriculture. Exposure of male
rats to X-rays, he said, had rendered them
sterile at the end of two months, the animals
regaining fertility when no longer subjected
to the rays.</p>

<p>If not handled with due caution and skill,
X-rays may do more harm than good, provoking
malignant growths as well as retarding their
development. As early as 1911, Otto Heese
published a record of 54 cases of cancer caused
by means of improper handling of these powerful
rays.</p>

<p>In the early days of X-ray therapy the nature
and effects of these radiations were wholly
unknown. Operators did not hesitate to test<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
and adjust their tubes by throwing the shadow
of their hands on the flouroscope. X-rays do
not make objects visible to the human eye, and
to see the effects of them it is necessary to
interpose a special screen between the eyes
and object through which the X-rays are to
penetrate. The cardboard screen is coated
with a fluorescent substance, such as barium-platinum-cyanide,
or calcium tungstate. This
screen is best placed in one end of a black
wooden or pasteboard box, against the other
end of which the eyes are placed when in use.</p>

<p>This screen under the influence of X-rays
becomes luminous and enables one to see
shadows or silhouettes of objects of denser
material interposed between the eyes and the
X-ray tube, when the tube is in operation.</p>

<span class="fs70">MARTYRS TO RADIOLOGY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was not until several years after the discovery
of X-rays by Roentgen, in December,
1895—after operators had been severely burned
in laboratories and hospitals all over the
world, and surgeons and physicians began to
compare notes, that the pathological effects of
X-rays were discovered and understood.</p>

<p>Says John Macy (in his memorial volume
on Walter James Dodd, heroic victim of 50
separate operations due to X-ray burn):</p>

<p>“It is easy now to understand what was
happening to Dodd and his contemporaries. In
a modern X-ray machine the strength of the
current, the quality of the spark, all the conditions,
are determined by metrical instruments.
In the early days the operator tested
his tube and adjusted it by throwing the
shadow of his hand on the fluoroscope; by the
look of the shadow he judged how the machine
was behaving. First he used the left hand
until that became too sore, then the right.
And until devices were found to focus and confine
the rays, the face of the operator was exposed,
and sometimes the neck and chest were
burned. A limited exposure to the X-ray is as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
harmless as a walk in the sunlight. It is the
repeated, continuous bombardment of the ray
that is calamitous. Dodd and the other pioneers
lived in the X-ray.”</p>

<p>John L. Bauer was the first victim of the
X-ray, in 1906. He was followed in 1914 by
Henry Green, who, although he knew he was
doomed, and in spite of the fact that he had
become almost helpless physically because so
much flesh had been cut away in amputating
cancerous growths, persisted in his work to the
end.</p>

<p>Major Eugene Wilson Caldwell of the Medical
Reserve Corps of the United States Army, the
inventor of the Caldwell liquid interrupter and
other devices for therapeutic use, lost his life
in 1918. Dr. Charles Infroit of the Salpetrière
Hospital, Paris, died on November 29, 1920. One
of Dr. Infroit’s hands became infected in 1898
as a result of his continuous use of the X-ray,
and an operation was performed. After that
he had 24 other operations, 22 of them performed
in the last ten years of his life, the last
on August 1, 1920, when his right arm and left
wrist were amputated.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles Vaillant, whose heroic services
to humanity have made necessary 13 amputations
until now he is armless, on February 19,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
1923, received from United States Ambassador
Herrick the Carnegie plaque, while the cravat
of the Paris Gold Medal of the French Legion
of Honor was conferred upon the martyr.
Physicians say further amputations are inevitable,
and that these will result in Vaillant’s
death.</p>

<p>In 1921, the eminent English radiologists, Dr.
Cecil Lyster and Dr. Ironside Bruce, and Dr.
Adolphe Leroy of the St. Antonie Hospital in
Paris, died martyrs to their noble profession.
“All of these men went knowingly to death.
Perhaps they did not take their sacrifices in
the spirit of the saint, possessed by a vision of
suffering humanity. Theirs may have been
the ardor of the scientist, the endurance of a
worker who hears the challenge of nature’s
silence and goes to battle. But in themselves
they express the powerful urge of a spirit that
longs to see, to feel, to know, and to possess
all the mysteries of the universe. It is the
same spirit that makes men rebel and agonize
for a better order of humanity. These men
seem better than the world that produces them.
But each of them, when he dies, may pull the
rest of humanity a little closer to his level.”</p>

<p>Dr. Frederick Henry Baetjer of Johns Hopkins
Hospital has only two of his ten fingers left.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
He lost the other eight as the result of burns
received in X-ray experimentation.</p>

<p>Dr. Francis Carter Wood, X-Ray and radium
expert of the Crocker Special Fund Cancer
Laboratory of New York, calls particular attention
to the fact that “the deaths which are occurring
now are the results of repeated exposures
ten or more years ago, when no one
knew what the effect of the rays might be. The
burns suffered then were the result of continuous
exposure without protection against the
rays. One exposure, or a moderate number of
them, would do no harm; but before the present
perfection of the apparatus it was necessary
to adjust the focus for each picture, and the
operator would do this by looking at his bare
hands through the fluoroscope. This resulted
in chronic burns, and the burned flesh formed
a fertile soil for cancer. Lead one-quarter of
an inch thick will stop both radium and X-rays.”</p>

<p>In Dr. Wood’s opinion, workers in X-rays today
“need not suffer any ill effects except
through their own carelessness.”</p>

<p>A discovery which promises to put an end
to the dangers to life and limb risked by those
who engage in working with X-rays was communicated
to the Academy of Sciences of Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
as early as May, 1920. It is the result of experiments
by Dr. Pesch of the Faculty of Montpelier,
who himself is one of the sufferers from
X-rays, and who has long been seeking the
means of protecting his young confrères.</p>

<p>He found that deep red rays are antagonistic
to the ultra-violet rays which produce irritation
and burning of the skin, and certain oxidations.
Thus, by the simultaneous application of both
rays he secures immunity for X-ray workers.
He has already proved that erythema can be
prevented by the application of red rays.
Daniel Berthelot, who announced the discovery
to the Academy, recalled that as long ago as
1872 the antagonism of extreme rays of the
spectrum had been foreseen by Becquerel in his
study of phosphorescence.</p>

<p>Dr. Pesch employs a filter composed of a
plastic material that allows only the red and
yellow rays to pass. It is claimed that by
means of this filter not only are the X-rays
made harmless, but its employment effects a
cure for radio-dermatitis, the affection which
has maimed or killed so many of the early
workers in X-ray therapy.</p>

<p>According to Dr. G. Contremoulins, Chief of
the principal laboratory of the Paris hospitals,
whose researches and experiments were begun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
in February, 1896, the usual methods of protection
even today are not always adequate. Says
he (in <cite>La Démocratie Nouvelle</cite>, Paris, April,
1921):</p>

<p>“Young radiologists, especially those born of
the war, take no heed of the experience acquired
by their elders, being quite convinced
that the glasses, gloves and aprons containing
lead offer a perfect protection—they even imagine
that strictly speaking they might get along
without them.</p>

<p>“Like a child which hides behind a wooden
door to shield itself from the bullets of a machine
gun, our young radiologists believe they
are safe when they have donned their gloves
and examine their patients behind a sheet of
lead glass. But, unfortunately, these enable
them only to avoid those superficial skin affections
caused by the most absorbable rays of
the spectrum.</p>

<p>“But they receive, alas, those other radiations
which are more penetrating, and these slowly
produce lesions of all the ductless glands in
the body, whose internal secretions we now
know to be of such vital importance in the
bodily economy.”</p>

<p>The modern employment of 200,000 volts under
three milliamperes gives rise to the need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
of great caution in the use of X-rays. Even
the health of persons in adjoining rooms or
buildings, Dr. Contremoulins believes may be
imperiled. In the <cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite>
for October, 1921, this veteran radiologist
makes some startling revelations. To quote a
few passages:</p>

<p>“In April, 1896, five months after the discovery
of X-rays—or Roentgen rays, as they
are also named in honor of their discoverer—a
pose of eight hours was required for a correct
radiograph of a profile head, the tube being
placed ten inches from the sensitive plate.</p>

<p>“In April, 1921, a similar image was obtained
in four hours at a distance of 90 yards from
the apparatus. This means that the radiation
with modern apparatus is more than 20,000
times stronger than was possible in 1896.</p>

<p>“With the very weak radiation that I have
used for my experiments, corresponding to the
ordinary radiographic and radioscopic work, it
has been easy for me to obtain images of metallic
objects and human bones placed on a sensitive
plate 15 feet from the radiating source,
although the rays pass directly through a slab
of marble an inch thick, a sheet of lead one-tenth
of an inch thick, and a flooring eight
inches deep, built of oak boards and rough
plaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“Fifty feet from this same source I have
been able in four hours to fog a photographic
plate placed behind a wall of brick and stone
20 inches thick. Also in the same time I have
obtained a correct radiograph of a skull and a
crab, 262 feet from the X-ray machine. All
these experiments were made with a 17-centimeter
spark and two milliamperes of current.</p>

<p>“If photographic plates are so readily affected
by these rays, we must admit that animal
cells also are affected to an appreciable
degree. The X-rays that are being used to cure
a patient may at the same time inflict radio-dermatitis
on other persons exposed to their
influence in adjoining rooms or buildings.
Nothing will suffice for safety but to cover the
walls and floors of X-ray rooms with sheets of
lead from a quarter to half an inch thick, according
to the power of the source and its distance
from the lining....</p>

<p>“Biologic reactions from X-rays take two
forms. The first is a skin lesion known as
radio-dermatitis, caused by the skin’s absorbing
a large quantity of radiations. The second
results from the improvements in X-ray tubes
and the use of filters absorbing the radiations
of long wave length, currently named ‘soft
radiation.’ This reaction takes place deep beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the skin upon the active cells that are
the most vulnerable. It is principally the internal
secretion glands that are affected.
Among those who continually receive even
weak doses, a gradual lessening of vitality
takes place, leading slowly to a physiological
impoverishment that inevitably carries them
off sooner or later.”</p>

<p>Dr. Contremoulins was able to escape serious
injury up to the outbreak of the World War,
but is now a victim of his services to wounded
soldiers. As a result of his efforts—and due
also, partly, to suits brought against a Paris
physician by neighbors who alleged that their
health had been impaired, resulting (perhaps)
in two cases of cancer—a thorough-going investigation
was undertaken by the French Ministry
of Hygiene.</p>

<p>Dr. Declere of the Academy of Medicine presided
over a committee which included Mme.
Curie, M. Becquerel, a radiologist; Dr. Vaillant
and a number of specialists. A leading member
of the Academy said he did not believe that
X-rays menaced persons who did not come into
direct contact with them.</p>

<p>“I intend to study the question by three
methods,” he said. “First, we shall make a
purely physical examination, studying the action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
of the rays and in what measure they
exert themselves at certain distances. Second,
we shall experiment with the living tissues of
rabbits, trying various distances several hours
a day and noting the effect on the red and
white corpuscles and glands of the animals.
Then, since it is impossible to make such experiments
on human bodies, we shall collect
data based on 25 years’ experience with X-rays
to see whether physicians in close contact have
been burned.”</p>

<p>While X-ray treatment cannot be said to
<em>cure</em> a deep-seated cancer, it is undoubtedly being
given with highly beneficial results in
many cases, alleviating much suffering and retarding
the growth of malignant tissues.</p>

<p>As is well known, tuberculosis can advance
to a dangerous stage before it exhibits physical
symptoms recognizable by physicians. The
X-ray not only brings to light incipient consumption,
but reveals the exact place and extent
of the lesion. Any abnormalities of the
alimentary tract, also, may readily be brought
to view, as well as certain effects produced on
certain arteries, due to arterio-sclerosis or to
angina pectoris (a very painful form of heart
disease).</p>

<p>It has been well said that “the list of diseases,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
the presence and extent of which are
betrayed or confirmed by the X-ray, would fill
pages and would include most of the enemies to
human health. Among them may be mentioned
many forms of tuberculosis, occult abscesses
whose ramifying consequences physicians were
once unable to refer to their source, tumors,
cancers, kidney stones, gastric ulcers, diseases
of the heart.”</p>

<p>The martyrdom of radiologists has not been
in vain.</p>

<p>In cases of emergency, X-ray diagnosis may
now be given patients in their own homes. A
surgical X-ray outfit that can be carried in an
ambulance and taken to the bedside of a patient
too ill for removal to a hospital passed a successful
trial in England, thus adapting an
emergency war-time arrangement to civilian
use. A generator in the ambulance operates
the tube, which has a special mounting that
enables it to be placed over the patient’s bed,
and adjusted for height and position by hand-wheels.
The control apparatus is mounted on
a separate stand, and connected with the ambulance
outside by a cable wound on a reel.
Provision is made for developing the exposed
plates at once, so that a diagnosis can be made
in a few minutes.</p>

<span class="fs70">DISCOVERY AND NATURE OF X-RAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In March, 1923, there passed from this world
one of the most beautiful exemplars of the true
scientific spirit that earth has ever seen—Dr.
William Conrad Roentgen, F.R.S., Professor of
Experimental Physics in the University of
Munich, the discoverer of X- or Roentgen Rays.</p>

<p>Born at Lennep, on March 27, 1845, Professor
Roentgen filled a number of important posts
before his death in 1923, in which year he was
awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics—an award
which brought with it a gift of $40,000. Although
suffering from the poverty which resulted
in Germany as an aftermath of the
World War, Professor Roentgen refused to utilize
the Nobel Prize award for his own personal
uses. He gave the entire sum to a research
society to enable other students to carry on
their investigations.</p>

<p>While occupying the chair of Professor of
Physics and Director of the Physical Institute
at Würzburg, Dr. Roentgen made the discovery—in
1895—for which his name is chiefly known—though
his researches led to important advances
in several other departments of physics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>While experimenting with a highly exhausted
vacuum tube on the conductivity of electricity
through gases, Dr. Roentgen noticed that a
paper screen covered with potassium platinocyanide—a
phosphorescent substance—which
chanced to be lying nearby, became fluorescent
under action of some radiation emitted from
the tube, which at the time was enclosed in a
box of black cardboard. Professor Roentgen
then found, by experiment, that this heretofore
unknown radiation had the power to pass
through various substances which are impenetrable
to ordinary light-rays. He found that
if a thick piece of metal—a coin, for example,—were
placed between the tube and a plate
covered with the phosphorescent substances,
a sharp shadow was cast upon the plate. On
the other hand, thin plates of aluminum and
pieces of wood cast only partial shadows.</p>

<p>Thus was it demonstrated that the rays
which produced the phosphorescence on the
glass of the vacuum tube could penetrate
bodies quite opaque to ordinary light-rays. Like
ordinary light, these rays affected a photographic
plate; but owing to their peculiar behavior
in regard to reflection and refraction,
Roentgen was led to put forward the hypothesis
that the rays were due to longitudinal, rather
than to transverse waves in the “ether.” They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
will ionize gases, but they cannot be reflected,
polarized or deflected by a magnetic or electric
field, as are ordinary light-rays. (It has been
shown that the <em>scattered</em> secondary rays show
polarization.)</p>

<p>Being in doubt as to the real nature of these
penetrating rays, Roentgen called them “X-rays.”</p>

<p>In 1896 Professor Roentgen was the recipient
of the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society.
This honor was shared by his compatriot
Philipp Lenard. Lenard was the discoverer of
the rays emanating from the outer surface of a
plate composed of (any) material permeable
by cathode rays. By impinging on solids, the
cathode rays (negative electrons) generate X-rays.
“Lenard rays,” which are similar in all
their known properties to cathode rays projected
from the cathode of a vacuum tube, do
not emanate from the cathode. (Unlike the X-rays,
cathode rays may be deflected from their
natural course along “straight lines” by the
application of a magnetic or electric field.)
Professor Lenard, as also Hertz, discoverer of
the now well-known “wireless waves,” had already
demonstrated that a portion of the
cathode rays could pass through a thin film of
a metal such as aluminum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>When Roentgen rays (X-rays) are allowed to
fall upon any substance, the matter emits cathodic
(or secondary Roentgen) rays. “The
characteristic secondary radiation may be compared
with the phosphorescence produced by
ultra-violet light, and the cathodic secondary
rays with the photoelectric effect” (Sir J. J.
Thomson).<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The penetrating power (“hardness”) of these
rays appears to be determined solely by the nature
of the elements in the emitting substance.
The velocity of the cathodic (or secondary
Roentgen) rays seems to be quite independent
of the matter exposed to the primary rays, but
increases as the hardness (penetrating power)
of the primary Roentgen rays increases.</p>

<p>The <em>character</em> of the emitted rays, in brief,
appears to be quite unaffected by the chemical
or physical condition of the element. Red-hot
iron, for example, exhibits the same characteristic
Roentgen radiation as iron at room temperature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
But the <em>penetrating power</em> (hardness)
of this characteristic (emitting) radiation
increases gradually and continuously with
increasing atomic weight of the emitting elements.
The complete independence of the penetrating
power of the characteristic Roentgen
radiation from external surroundings indicates
strongly that it is closely connected with the
nature of the nuclei (“cores”) of the atoms
giving rise to it.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> When ultra-violet light is allowed to fall upon
a metal it causes the metal to emit electrons and
thus to acquire a positive charge, the velocity of
the emitted electrons being exactly proportional to
the frequency of the incident light. Or when light
of X-ray type falls upon the surface of almost any
substance, it takes hold of an electron in the atoms
of that surface and hurls it out into space with a
speed exactly proportional to the wave length of
the light. This phenomenon is known as the photoelectric
effect.</p>

<span class="fs70">ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT IN HEALTH AND DISEASE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>That both the compound rays of ordinary
sunlight and ultra-violet rays (“artificial sunlight”)
are highly effective in the treatment of
a number of complaints is now well known.
They are both in general use for the external
treatment of rickets, tuberculosis, and a number
of other diseases. Light-rays are also applied
to hasten the healing of wounds.</p>

<p>The use of the sun as a healing agent seems
first to have been developed in a scientific way
by Dr. Neils R. Finsen, a young Danish physician
who was later awarded the Nobel Prize
in Medicine. His original researches were undertaken
toward the end of the 19th century.
Then Dr. Rollier opened the first sunlight
clinic in 1903, and in 1910 established his school
at Leysin, in the Alps. Dr. Rollier is now treating
about 1,000 patients, mostly afflicted with
various forms of tuberculosis of the bone. The
sun cure is also used to some extent for pulmonary
tuberculosis, and with considerable success.
(See my <cite>Man’s Debt to the Sun</cite>, Little
Blue Book No. 808, Chapter IV.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>According to Dr. Rollier, exposure of the diseased
to the sun’s rays is efficacious in the
treatment of anemia, malnutrition, bone and
gland infections and various types of tuberculosis,
and is a body builder for convalescents.
On the outskirts of San Rafael, California, is
a novel sun sanitarium, Helios Sanitarium, modeled
after the Alpine sanitaria of Dr. Rollier.</p>

<p>Two investigators have recently studied the
comparative germ-destroying power of the
blood in healthy and ill persons, before and
after exposure to sunlight. It was found that
the germ-killing power of the blood was increased
when the sun bath lasted for a certain
length of time. It was shown that too long or
too short an exposure decreased the blood’s
power. It was decreased also in patients who
had fever. Several other conditions were found
to influence the results. Physicians believe
that several points of practical value may
emerge from these experiments. One important
and useful result is that they offer a new
method to guide and gauge the effects of treatment
in tuberculosis and other diseases.</p>

<p>The practice of X-ray treatment (since 1910
included under the more general term <em>radiotherapy</em>)
includes treatment not only by X-rays,
but also by all kinds of rays—treatment by
heat, by the sun’s rays, by ultra-violet rays, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
even by violet rays. The rays of radioactive
substances used in medicine come under the
etymological term of radiotherapy. But in general
practice, amongst radiologists, the term is
applied to treatment by X-rays alone. Nevertheless,
it is now well established that the
ultra-violet rays are not only bactericidal, but
that they also play an important role in the
treatment of certain diseases, and in the maintenance
of good health. On the other hand,
these rays produce a certain irritability among
persons of the white race in the tropics, which
cannot be regarded as healthful in their general
effects.</p>

<p>Since the amount of ultra-violet light coming
from the sun has been shown by Abbott to be
variable, it may be that some of the irritability
which seems to be general among the inmates
of our public institutions on certain days is due
to this change in the sun’s outpour of ultra-violet
radiation. As Dr. E. E. Free remarked
not long ago:</p>

<p>“Put these facts together. Ultra-violet rays
affect life. The amount of ultra-violet coming
from the sun is variable. Does this mean that
some of the obscure, day by day variations of
health can be due to this? Some days everybody
seems happy and cheerful. Other days
everybody is depressed. Still other days are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
breeders of ‘nerves.’ Maybe the ultra-violet
does it. Maybe not. Doubtless the investigators
will find out presently.”</p>

<p>Recent experiments at the Maine Agricultural
Experiment Station, conducted under the direction
of Dr. John W. Gowen, have led to the
important discovery that milk from cows that
have been treated with ultra-violet light, from
mercury-vapor quartz lamps, contains a much
larger amount of the substance—presumably a
vitamine, or vitamines—that prevents rickets
in children and young animals. At any rate,
it was found that the milk from cows deprived
of sunlight and ultra-violet light was quite deficient
in the anti-rachitic factor. Animals and
birds fed on the sunless milk uniformly developed
rickets.</p>

<p>The Holstein-Friesian cows used in the experiments
were of nearly the same age and
calving date and all received like treatment as
to feed, temperature, etc., and stood side by
side in the same barn. “Throughout the treatment,”
says Dr. Gowen, “these cows did not
leave the barn. For one month none of the
cows received ultra-violet light. For the second
month two cows received ultra-violet light 15
minutes a day, generated from a Cooper-Hewitt
alternating current light at three feet above
their backs. For the third month these cows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
received ultra-violet light for 30 minutes a day
under the same conditions. In the meantime
Rhode Island Red chickens were allowed to develop
rickets, shown both clinically and by X-ray
photographs. They were divided into two
lots, one lot of these chickens receiving milk
from the ultra-violet cows, the other of two lots
of chickens, milk from the control cows. Both
lots received all the milk they wished.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The chickens have now been under treatment 50
days. The lot receiving milk from cows exposed
to ultra-violet light are in good condition with no
appearance of rickets in X-ray plates. The lot receiving
normal milk has moved progressively toward
more extreme clinical and X-ray rickets. The
experiment was repeated, using the milk from these
same cows on White Leghorn chickens showing
clinical and X-ray rickets. Five chickens were in
each lot. After 38 days’ treatment four of the lot
receiving milk from the ultra-violet cows are almost
cured of rickets, showing only a very slight
stiffness. The fifth chicken shows some stiffness.
Four of the lot receiving the normal milk show
constantly increasing symptoms of the more advanced
stages of clinical rickets.</p>

<p>These results point to the conclusion that more
of the substance necessary to cure rickets is absorbed
by the cow exposed to ultra-violet light and
secreted by her in her milk. The cows prevented
from receiving ultra-violet light are not able to secrete
this anti-rachitic substance in sufficient quantities
to cure or allay the process of clinical rickets.
The results thus point to an environmental factor
transmitted by the cow to her offspring through
the medium of her milk. They further suggest
that the high incidence of rickets in children during
the late winter months is due to their mothers
not receiving ultra-violet light either during pregnancy
or while in lactation. Furthermore, it would
appear that cows’ milk produced especially for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
baby-feeding should be from cows which have access
to ultra-violet light either from the sun or
from some other source.</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. C. C. Little of the University of Maine,
and his associates, fully demonstrated the value
of sunlight to animal life through experiments
on a flock of 233 chicks. The chicks were
divided into three groups and all were given the
same diet. One group was kept in natural sunlight,
the second was kept in sunlight that went
through window glass, and the third was given
both natural sunlight and extra ultra-violet
rays produced artificially. The last class grew
the best. The class that got only natural sunlight
grew normally. The class kept behind
window glass all developed bone disease. The
glass of the greenhouse allowed the light of the
sun and the heat of infra-red rays to get
through. But it screened out the ultra-violet
waves.</p>

<p>The beneficent effects of invisible ultra-violet
rays are seen in both the organism exposed
to them and the food consumed. This is
true whether the rays come direct from the sun
or by means of a quartz lamp. Ordinary glass
lamps prevent the ultra-violet rays from passing
out. But not all kinds of foodstuffs by
any means are favorably affected by the rays.
Only those foods which contain fat seem to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
materially improved. The value of milk and of
cod liver oil is greatly enhanced by exposure to
the rays. Dr. Benjamin Kramer has been highly
successful in treating babies affected with
rickets by subjecting milk itself to the action
of ultra-violet light.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>As early as 1923, it had been shown by feeding
experiments with various types of animals
at the University of Wisconsin that sunlight
was acting either directly upon the animal or
upon its food. The same dietary was found
to produce contradictory results. It was established—especially
by H. Steenbock and E. B.
Hart—that sunlight is indispensable to man
and beast, in that it is the determinant of the
efficiency with which calcium can be assimilated
and retained. (See their report, <cite>Journal
of Biological Chemistry</cite>, Vol. 62, page 577, 1925.)
Calcium, it is pointed out, needs to be conserved
because in proportion to the body needs
it is not found abundantly in foods and feeds.
Steenbock and Hart tell us that sunlight plays
the particular rôle of conservator “by virtue of
its content of ultra-violet radiations of approximately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
250 to 302 millimicrons in wave-length,
but unfortunately these are not present in sufficient
degree to provide a wide margin of
safety for the animal. As a result we have
rickets in the young and poor dentition, restricted
lactation, abortion and impoverishment
of the skeleton in lime to a dangerous extent
in the adult.... The ultra-violet rays bring
their effect through the medium of certain compounds
widely distributed in plant and animal
tissue, so that practically any foodstuff can be
‘anti-rachitically’ activated. ‘Make hay while
the sun shines’ is more than a mere poetic
slogan, for hay made in the dark is devoid of
rickets-preventing properties” (<cite>Science</cite>, December
4, 1925).</p>

<p>The careful experiments of J. S. Hughes
showed that chickens receiving a standard
scratch feed and mash, supplemented with
sprouted oats and buttermilk, developed rickets
(weak legs) when deprived of direct sunlight.
Chicks receiving the same feed but
given sun baths developed normally, although
they were confined in a very small pen, with
little opportunity to exercise. Light from ordinary
electric bulbs had very little, if any,
beneficial action. Light from the Hereus mercury
arc lamp was very beneficial. Cod liver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
oil also proved to be effective in preventing
rickets in chickens as in mammals.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>That such fats as olive oil and lard may be
activated by exposure to ultra-violet rays and
used as a substitute for cod liver oil in the
treatment of rickets is evidenced by experiments
reported by the Department of Agricultural
Chemistry of the University of Wisconsin.
In the series of experiments now published,
olive oil and lard were exposed to the action of
the ultra-violet rays from a powerful mercury-vapor
quartz lamp, for periods of time ranging
from half an hour to 17 hours.</p>

<p>After exposure to the rays these fats were
fed to a group of experimental rats in which
rickets had been produced, and the activated
olive oil and lard were found to have the same
beneficial results that follow the administration
of cod liver oil. The weight of the rats increased
and an analysis of the bones showed
an increase in the calcium content.</p>

<p>Some of the activated olive oil, which had
been stored in a stoppered bottle, showed no
change in potency ten months later. It was
found also that the fats might be activated by
the rays from the open carbon arc, the iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
arc, and sunlight; but that exposure for such
prolonged periods as 17 hours destroyed their
potency. This destruction took place even on
cod liver oil.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It has long been known that human tissue is
more actively changed by light when it has
been “sensitized.” Quinine, esculin, fluoresceine,
etc., are examples of tissue sensitizers,
in addition to their other effects. The most
powerful of all known sensitizers is haemato-porphyrin—or
simply “porphyrin.” This sensitizer
is a purple substance closely allied to the
haemoglobin that gives blood its red color.
Subtracting its iron and albumin from haemoglobin
by appropriate chemical processes leaves
porphyrin. This substance reacts strongly to
the ultra-violet rays, in rare cases causing a
disease which turns the teeth to a deep purple
hue. Victims of this uncommon ailment have
to wear gloves constantly, and when going out
of doors during the day time must put on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
heavy veils.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Porphyrin is capable of dissolving
the red corpuscles of the most dissimilar
animals in the presence of sunlight. But
neither the haemato-porphyrin nor the light
alone is capable of injuring the animals. Only
the combined effect of the two can harm them.
A physician experimentally injected an exceedingly
minute quantity into himself and then exposed
himself to a moderate light, and became
very ill.</p>

<p>Hausmann found that even the diffused sunlight
of an early spring day in Vienna was
sufficient to cause the death of white mice
which had been subjected to small quantities
of this strange substance. Dr. E. C. Van Leersum,
of Holland, proved by experiments with
rats that the utilization of lime by our bodies
can be controlled almost at will by this “sensitization”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
process. Rickets, or a condition
indistinguishable from rickets, can be produced
or cured by proper control of the sensitization.</p>

<h2><span class="fs70">SUNLIGHT AND INFANTILE PARALYSIS</span></h2>

<p>An article by Science Service, quoted in
<cite>Science</cite>, September 11, 1925, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Another of the dreaded diseases of childhood, infantile
paralysis, which, like rickets, graduates
large quotas of cripples, has responded to the good
influence of the sun’s rays. Dr. G. Murray Levick,
medical director of the Heritage Craft Schools at
Chailey, Sussex (England), who originated the
treatment, said that no other method has ever had
as good results as this in the treatment of infantile
paralysis.</p>

<p>Dr. Levick first deduced that neurasthenia in
grown-ups and rickets in the young are due to the
same cause. Both these diseases, he claims, are
nutritional disturbances of the nerve centers affecting
the bones in the young, and the nervous
systems in the old. The action of sunlight on the
skin forms a substance which is carried into the
blood and feeds the nerve centers as well as the
bones. His success in treating neurasthenia with
sun’s rays led him to apply it to cases of infantile
paralysis, a disease which is a severe shock to the
nervous system and which results in muscular
atrophy. Under the action of sunlight a renutrition
of nerve centers takes place.</p>

<p>Synthetic sunlight produced by him with an electric
arc light of his own invention proved as good
as natural sunlight, and could be better regulated
to the patient’s endurance. He used two distinct
kinds of light-rays, the short ultra-violet rays for
nerve nutrition, and the long red and infra-red
rays for muscle treatment. Red rays, as can be
seen when the hand is held up against the sunlight,
penetrate the flesh to a considerable extent,
and can therefore stimulate the sleeping muscle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Levick warns that immediate success must
not be expected. He has found constant improvement
where short daily treatments were continued
over a period of several years. While the method
may not be effective in extreme cases, it is nevertheless
a test which will soon show after a few
treatments whether any rejuvenation of the nerve
fiber is taking place.</p>
</div>

<p>It is now admitted that the (red) heat-waves
may play some part in heliotherapy—exposure
to direct sunlight for medical purposes. Dr.
Lazarus-Barlow, Professor of Experimental
Pathology in the University of London, concludes
that even though heat-rays may also
play some part in curative processes, “experience
of the treatment of wounds by sunlight
in France during the World War indicated that
a degree of benefit arises from exposure to sunlight
which cannot be attributable to warmth
and ultra-violet rays. On the other hand, in
the Finsen light treatment of lupus (a tubercular
affection of the skin of the face, occurring
in several forms) and in the treatment of
tuberculosis at high altitudes, ultra-violet rays
play a predominant part.”</p>

<p>As the ultra-violet rays penetrate but a fraction
of a millimeter into the epithelium, “it is
uncertain how the rays act.” The suggestion
is here ventured that since the recently discovered
Millikan Rays are particularly powerful
under the same conditions that make application<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of the ultra-violet rays practicable as
a therapeutic agency, it may later be found
that these highly penetrating rays, of exceedingly
short wave length, aid greatly in effecting
some of the cures now attributed wholly to
the longer (and less penetrating) ultra-violet
rays or the much shorter X-rays.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Professor Lazarus-Barlow calls attention to
the fact that it is precisely those tubercular
persons who tan easily who are said to derive
the greatest benefit from a sojourn at high
altitude.</p>

<p>Very remarkable is a recently adopted machine
which “pours ultra-violet light through
a funnel down the throat of a patient.” The
new apparatus, first used in London, is employed
for treatment of various mouth and
throat diseases, “thus making it possible for
patients to take internal baths of artificial sunlight”
(<cite>Science</cite>, February 26, 1926).</p>

<p>In England, where the sky is so often overclouded,
it is natural that much attention has
been given to ultra-violet ray therapy. A recent
press dispatch tells us:</p>

<p>“London recently had 23 consecutive days on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
which no beam of the sun could force its way
through the mantle of cloud and fog which
spread over that section of England. Now the
Britons are making artificial suns that may
be available for both indoor and outdoor illumination.
Arc lights throwing powerful ultra-violet
rays are being installed in beauty shops
and hotels, and patrons are given opportunity
to bathe their bodies in this brilliance. These
rays are being billed as more potent than sun
baths, and citizens who have small chance to
see the orb of day get their sunshine and their
medicine at one swoop.”</p>

<p>Two Indian scientists, S. S. Bhatnagar and
R. B. Lal, of the University of the Punjab,
Lahore, discovered in 1925 that germs grow
faster when exposed to “polarized” light than
to ordinary light. (Ordinary light—according
to the undulatory theory—is due to vibrations
transverse to the direction of the ray, but varying
so rapidly as to show no particular direction
of their own, the fronts of the light-waves
crisscrossing at all angles. When, by any
means, these vibrations are given a definite
direction, the light is said to be <em>polarized</em>, the
fronts of the waves being all arranged in the
same direction, though the path of the rays
may be plane, elliptical, circular, or rotary, according
to the method of polarization employed.)</p>

<p>The Indian experimenters took cultures of
the germs of typhoid fever and cholera, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
exposed one set to ordinary light, and another
to a beam of polarized light. The latter multiplied
much faster than did the germs under
ordinary light.</p>

<p>It was demonstrated in 1925 by Dr. Elizabeth
S. Semmens, of Bedford College, London,
that the digestion of starch takes place more
readily under polarized light than in ordinary
light.</p>

<p>Prolonged exposure to the ultra-violet rays
will destroy any germs known to science.
(Cathode rays—which are shorter than ultra-violet
rays—will kill not only germs, but insects
as well, by means of a device developed
by Prof. W. D. Coolidge.)</p>

<p>“Bacteria,” says Dr. Coolidge, “have been
rayed, and an exposure of a tenth of a second
has been found sufficient to kill even highly
resistant bacterial spores. Fruit flies, upon
being rayed for a small fraction of a second,
instantly showed almost complete collapse, and
in a few hours were dead.”</p>

<p>This may lead to the application of cathode
rays as a germicide, but their effect on higher
forms of life shows that their unskilled use
would be most dangerous. For example, Dr.
Coolidge relates:</p>

<p>“The ear of a rabbit was rayed over a circular
area one centimeter in diameter for one
second. After several days a scab formed
which fell off a few days later, taking the hair
with it. Two weeks later a profuse growth
of snow-white hair started which soon became
much longer than the original gray hair. Another
area was rayed for 50 seconds. In this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
case, scabs developed on both sides of the ear,
which scabs later fell out, leaving a hole. The
edge of this hole is now covered with snow-white
hair.”</p>

<p>A very interesting problem to scientists relates
to the question as to whether or not insects
are color-blind. It may be that we now
have at least a partial answer to this vexed
question, and in terms of ultra-violet radiations.</p>

<p>Dr. Frank E. E. Germann, of Cornell University,
calls attention to some recent experiments
which show conclusively that at least
one kind of insects (flies) have a range of
vision in the ultra-violet, just as we have in the
visible spectrum. It was also made “perfectly
evident that flowers do have their characteristic
ultra-violet radiations” (<cite>Science</cite>, March
26, 1926, page 325). It is due “to our own
egotism that we call the insect color-blind.”</p>

<p>A given type of insect might in reality be
visiting flowers of the same color as far as it
was concerned, while to us it appeared to be
visiting flowers of all colors. “Might not two
flowers, one red and one blue, both give out the
same group of wave lengths in the ultra-violet,
and thus be identical in color to an insect seeing
only the ultra-violet? Moreover, what is to
prevent two different kinds of red flowers from
giving out two entirely different sets of wave
lengths in the ultra-violet, and thus appearing
to have entirely different colors to an insect?”</p>

<p>In a very real sense, science is only at the
beginning of the discoveries it will yet make in
its investigations of the nature and action of
ultra-violet, cathode and X-rays.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> The only creature that has porphyrin as part
of its normal body-covering is a tropical bird called
the touraco, parts of whose feathers are dyed a
brilliant red by a porphyrin-copper compound
known as turacin. This pigment is remarkable also
because it seems to be the only normal occurrence
of copper as a coloring compound in feathers or
skin. Turacin is soluble in weak alkali, so that
when it rains and the bird comes into contact with
such alkaline solutes as frequently occur in nature,
the turacin bleaches out! Although porphyrin is
rare as a normal coloring in adult animals, it is
the commonest pigment found in the shells of birds’
eggs. Almost all eggs, from the hen’s brown to the
robin’s blue, contain it.</p>
